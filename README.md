# Project - Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

# Project Description
The project aims to predict medical insurance costs using machine learning techniques. The code utilizes a dataset containing information about individuals, including attributes such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. Based on this data, the code builds a predictive model to estimate medical insurance costs for new individuals.

# Business Challenge
The challenge is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate medical insurance costs for individuals. The project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze the relationships between various factors and medical insurance costs. By building an effective prediction model, this project can provide valuable insights for insurance companies, healthcare providers, and individuals seeking to estimate their potential medical expenses.

By successfully predicting medical insurance costs, this project contributes to the fields of healthcare and insurance by providing a data-driven approach to estimating medical expenses. The insights gained from the predictive model can be used to optimize insurance offerings, improve cost management, and enhance decision-making for both insurance providers and individuals.
